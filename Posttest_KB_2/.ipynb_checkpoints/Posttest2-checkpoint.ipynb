While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game.

The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay. Though the game is set in the future, its style and content incorporates many aspects of 1980's old school hip hop culture, as well as 1990's J-pop culture.

This game does not have that problem. Compared to the first game, the controls are a lot tighter and the camera doesn't nearly have as many issues. That being said, this isn't a whole improvement over the first game, as the level structure for this game is more wide and open ended, leading to level design that isn't as polished IMO. Lots of tall vertical shafts you have to precariously climb up where one wrong move sends you all the way back down, and stuff like that gets kinda tedious after a while. Aesthetically it is on par with the original game, though I will say the licensed half of the soundtrack is weaker here than it was in game 1. This is definitely the most modern feeling JSR so it's an actual crime that this game has never been rereleased in the over 20 years since it has came out as of me writing this review.

The players are on a 2-dimensional overlay map with sprites where they engage enemies to finish their mission. When a player receives a Biometal, he is able to change form, gaining various abilities, such as the charge moves, or charging the player's weapon with an element of that Biometal; for example, Biometal H will charge the weapon with electricity. While in a special form, using the form-specific abilities use up weapon energy. When the player receives the other half of the Biometal, he is able to perform a different special ability.
